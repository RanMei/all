convertible bond and bond with warrant are both corporate bond, which means bond issued by a company.

Corporate bonds are considered higher risk than government bonds. As a result, interest rates are almost always higher, even for top-flight credit quality companies.

As the name implies, convertible bonds, or converts, give the holder the option to exchange the bond for a predetermined number of shares in the issuing company.

WHAT IT IS:

A convertible bond gives the bondholder the right to convert the bond into a fixed number of shares of common stock in the issuing company.

HOW IT WORKS (EXAMPLE):

For example, consider a Company XYZ bond with a $1,000 par value that is convertible into Company XYZ common stock. It has a coupon of 6%, payable annually. The bond’s prospectus specifies a conversion ratio, which is the number of shares that the investor will receive if he chooses to convert.  In this example, Company XYZ’s convertible bond has a conversion ratio of 20. The investor is effectively purchasing 20 shares of Stock XYZ for $50 per share ($1000 / 20 = $50).
 
The bondholder keeps the bond for two years and collects a $60 interest payment each year. At the end of year two, he elects to convert his bond into 20 shares of stock. By this time, the stock price has risen to $75 per share. The bondholder converts his bond to 20 shares at $75 per share, and now his investment is worth $1,500.
 
What makes this feature attractive to investors is that it allows bondholders to participate in the appreciation of the underlying security. 
 
The conversion ratio is not the only aspect of a convertible bond to analyze. Like other bonds, convertible bonds usually offer a coupon, and their prices are based on prevailing market rates and the credit quality of the issuer.
WHY IT MATTERS:

A firm issuing debt may add a convertibility feature to make the bonds more attractive to investors. The firm may be able to get a lower interest rate or better terms by adding a convertibility feature.

From the investor's perspective, a convertibility feature allows for collection of a steady stream of interest income plus an opportunity to take advantage of future stock price appreciation. Investors should be aware of the issuer's credit quality before investing and that there is reinvestment risk if the bond is callable. Investors should thoroughly review a bond’s prospectus before investing.

Example 
Suppose that TSJ Sports issues $10 million in three-year convertible bonds with a 5% yield and a 25% premium. This means that TSJ will have to pay $500,000 in interest annually, or a total $1.5 million over the life of the converts.
If TSJ\'s stock was trading at $40 at the time of the convertible bonds issue, investors would have the option of converting those bonds for shares at a price of $50 ($40 x 1.25 = $50). Therefore if the stock was trading at say $55 by the bond\'s expiration date, that $5 difference per share is profit for the investor. However there is usually a cap on the amount the stock can appreciate through the issuer\'s callable provision. 
For instance, TSJ executives won\'t allow the share price to surge to $100 without calling their bonds - and capping investors\' profits. Alternatively, if the stock price tanks to $25 the convert holders would still be paid the face value of the $1,000 bond at maturity. This means that while convertible bonds limit risk if the stock price plummets, they also limit exposure to upside price movement if the common stock soars.

可转换债券的持有人 拥有 以一定转换比例把手中持有的某公司可转换债券转换为该公司股票的 期权。


发行可转换债券的公司  希望能  用期权来吸引投资者并使债券的利率低一些。

案例：
45:1的转换比例意味着  面值为1000美元的一张债券 可以转换为 45股（股票）。

如果A公司发行可转换债券时，该公司的股票的交易价格为40美元，

因此，如果股票的交易价格涨到了每股55美元，

比如说，A公司的管理层绝不会在股价飙升到每股100美元的时候  还不购回  他们发行的可转换债券的。
而股价跌到每股25美元时，债券是不会受到影响的。

A detachable warrant is often combined with various forms of debt offerings and can be removed by the holder and sold in the secondary market separately.
Many companies choose detachable warrants when issuing bonds because it makes a debt offering more attractive and can be an effective method of raising new capital. The exposure to the right given by the detachable warrant can often gain the attention of investors who do not usually participate in the fixed-income markets. 
A detachable warrant can be traded independently of the package with which it was offered, and is similar to a call option.

Those companies wanting to sweeten the deal for investors might also choose to include an equity warrant.

If investors purchase a bond that contains an equity warrant, they have the right to purchase stock from that company at a specific price at some point in the future, though they are not obligated to do so. This option becomes valuable if the price of the stock goes up in the future. When that occurs, the investor holding a warrant can buy the shares at the lower predetermined price, sell the shares for the higher current market price, and pocket the difference. He or she could also hold onto the stock and hopes that it continues to rise in value.

In most cases, an equity warrant comes with a date at which the option becomes void. This date is generally years after the bond is purchased, giving investors much more time than in typical stock options, which usually expire in a matter of months. Investors might also choose to sell the option on the secondary market and gain benefit from it in that manner.

It is important to realize that the equity warrant, even if it is exercised, does not replace the debt obligations placed upon the issuing company. The fact that the investor can cash in on the stock and still receive bond interest as well as the return of his or her initial bond investment is what makes this warrant so valuable. This arrangement can also be beneficial to the companies, which can receive capital twice from investors if the stock option is exercised.

What Are Bonds With Warrants?
by John DeMerceau

When you buy a bond with an attached warrant, the warrant gives you the right to buy a certain number of fixed-price shares of the stock of the company that issues the bond. You are not obligated to purchase the stock, and the price specified on the warrant may be different from the price at which the stock is trading on the day you buy your bonds.

Reason for Warrants
A company issues bonds when it needs to borrow money from public or private investors. Bonds are physical or electronic documents that guarantee whoever purchases them a fixed or variable rate of interest. Companies can sell bonds with warrants that allow buyers to purchase stock at a certain price, often within a given amount of time. They often follow this strategy when they want to offer bonds at a percentage rate lower than is usual for companies with a similar value or performance rating.

Mechanism and Terminology
Warrants are considered detachable, which means they can be sold or redeemed separately. The price at which the warrant holder can buy shares of stock is called the strike price or exercise price. Most warrants can be traded on financial exchanges, and in some cases companies provide incentives to bondholders who sell or exercise their warrants before the warrants expire. For example, a company may not pay a dividend to a bondholder who still has outstanding warrants.

Exercising and Selling Warrants
When warrants are traded independently of their accompanying bonds, they can rise in price as the underlying stock price rises. The exercise price of a warrant on its day of issue is usually higher than the price of the stock on the same day. Nevertheless, the price of the stock may rise during the period of validity for the warrant, which can be as long as five years. When this happens, the price of the warrant rises as well. The bondholder who received the warrants can either purchase the stock at a lower price or sell the warrants at an advantageous price.

Similar Investments
Convertible bonds are similar to bonds with warrants in that both types of securities enable the buyer to purchase company stock at a certain price. The difference is that holders of bonds with warrants retain the bonds and either sell the warrants or use additional funds to buy stock, whereas investors who buy convertible bonds use the bonds to buy stock. Call options are also somewhat similar to warrant bonds in that they give holders the right to buy stock at a certain price and can be traded. Call options have no underlying value, however, so if they sink to below the price that an investor pays for them, the investor does not have a bond that continues to hold value.

One site suggested the difference is that the warrant in the bond with warrant is a fixed price on company stock. E.g. for a $1000 bond, you can buy 500 shares at $2 each. And that convertible bonds does not have a fixed price term.
Another site suggested that with a bond with warrant, the warrant can be sold separately from the bond, while a convertible bond has not that possibility.
Are any of these suggestions correct, or is it something else that make up the (major) difference?

A warrant allows a holder to BUY a stock at a set price. Because there is a specific price, all that is needed is CASH to get the stock. As such, the warrant can be separated from the bond, and someone else could use it. As a result, it is valued separately from an accounting perspective.

A convertible bond, on the other hand, simply allows the holder to TRADE the bond for some stock. Since the holder needs the BOND to get the stock (vs. cash), the value of the trade cannot be separated from the stock.
